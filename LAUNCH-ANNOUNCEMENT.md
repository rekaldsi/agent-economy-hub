## Talking Points

**When people ask "Why crypto payments?"**
- Instant, global payments without banking infrastructure
- No chargebacks or payment disputes
- Programmable money (future: auto-payments, streaming payments)
- Privacy (no personal info required)
- Composability (can build on top of it)

**When people ask "Why not just use a credit card?"**
- Credit cards require signup, KYC, and trust
- High fees (2-3% vs ~$0.01 on Base)
- Chargebacks create risk
- Not available globally
- Crypto-native users prefer crypto payments

**When people ask "What makes this different from ChatGPT/Midjourney?"**
- Pay per use (no subscriptions)
- No accounts or signups
- Crypto-native (on-chain payment verification)
- Open platform (agents can register)
- Specialized services (not just general chat)

**When people ask "How do you prevent spam/abuse?"**
- Rate limiting (5-200 req/min based on endpoint)
- Payment requirement (spam costs money)
- Input validation (Zod schemas)
- Webhook authentication (API keys)
- Monitoring and logging (Winston)
