- Ensure good lighting/contrast if using camera
- Clean up desktop background if showing taskbar

### Browser Setup
- Full width browser window (not tiny)
- Zoom at 100% (not zoomed in/out)
- Hide bookmarks bar (cleaner look)
- Close unnecessary browser extensions
- Use private/incognito mode (clean, no extensions)

### Content
- Use realistic example prompts (not "test" or "hello")
- Show actual results (not errors or loading states)
- Ensure MetaMask has reasonable balance (not $0.00)
- Clear any test data that looks unprofessional

### Privacy
- Don't show your full wallet address (blur if needed)
- Don't show transaction hashes (blur if needed)
- Don't show personal email/username
- Use demo data where possible

**What to do**:

1. **Create MONITORING.md** in project root:

```markdown
# Production Monitoring Guide

Observability and monitoring recommendations for Agent Economy Hub in production.

## Overview

This guide covers what to monitor, how to monitor it, and when to act on alerts in production.

**Philosophy**: Monitor what matters. Don't drown in metrics. Focus on user experience and system health.

---

## Critical Metrics to Monitor

### 1. Application Health 🏥

**What to monitor:**
- `/health` endpoint returning 200 (service is running)
- `/ready` endpoint returning 200 (database connection works)
- No critical errors in logs
- Memory and CPU usage within normal range

**How to monitor:**
- **Railway Dashboard**: Memory/CPU graphs
- **Uptime monitoring**: UptimeRobot, Pingdom, Better Uptime
- **Log monitoring**: Winston logs via `railway logs`

**Alert when:**
- `/health` returns 503 for > 2 minutes
- Memory usage > 80% for > 10 minutes
- CPU usage > 90% for > 5 minutes
- Critical error rate > 5/minute

**How to fix:**
- Check `railway logs` for errors
- Check DATABASE_URL is valid
- Restart service if needed (Railway dashboard)
- Scale up if resource-constrained

---

### 2. Payment Flow Success Rate 💰

**What to monitor:**
- Payment verification success/failure rate
- Payment amount accuracy (< 0.1% tolerance)
- Average payment verification time
- Payment-related errors

**How to monitor:**
- Check Winston logs for "Payment verified" vs "Payment verification failed"
- Monitor `/api/stats` endpoint (tracks request counts)
- Review USDC balance in HUB_WALLET_ADDRESS

**Alert when:**
- Payment verification failure rate > 5%
- Payment verification time > 30 seconds
- No payments received for > 24 hours (might indicate issue)

**How to fix:**
- Check ALCHEMY_API_KEY is valid
- Check Base network RPC status (status.base.org)
- Check Alchemy dashboard for rate limits
- Verify HUB_WALLET_ADDRESS is correct

---

### 3. AI Generation Success Rate 🤖

**What to monitor:**
- Text generation success/failure rate
- Image generation success/failure rate
- Average generation time
- AI API errors (Anthropic, Replicate)

**How to monitor:**
- Check Winston logs for "AI generation complete" vs "AI generation failed"
- Monitor API response times in logs
- Track AI API costs (Anthropic dashboard, Replicate dashboard)

**Alert when:**
- AI generation failure rate > 10%
- Text generation time > 60 seconds
- Image generation time > 120 seconds
- API rate limit errors

**How to fix:**
- Check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is valid and has credits
- Check REPLICATE_API_TOKEN is valid and has credits
- Review Anthropic usage dashboard for rate limits
- Review Replicate dashboard for queue times
- Consider adding more API credits if near limit

---

### 4. Rate Limiting & Abuse 🚦

**What to monitor:**
- Rate limit trigger frequency
- Repeated requests from same IP
- Unusual request patterns (bots, scrapers)
- High-volume endpoints

**How to monitor:**
- Check Winston logs for "rate limit exceeded"
- Review `/api/stats` endpoint (request counts by path)
- Monitor request patterns in Railway logs

**Alert when:**
- Rate limit triggers > 100/hour (might indicate attack)
- Single IP making > 1000 requests/hour
- Unusual traffic spike (10x normal volume)

**How to fix:**
- Review rate limits in `src/index.js` (adjust if needed)
- Consider adding IP-based blocking for abusers
- Add CAPTCHA if bot traffic becomes problematic
- Scale up if legitimate traffic increase

---

### 5. Database Performance 💾

**What to monitor:**
- Query response times
- Database connection pool usage
- Database size and growth rate
- Slow queries (> 1 second)

**How to monitor:**
- Railway dashboard → PostgreSQL metrics
- Winston logs for slow query warnings

---

## Incident Response Playbook

### If site is down (503 errors):

1. **Check Railway dashboard** → is service running?
2. **Check logs** → `railway logs | tail -100`
3. **Check health** → `curl https://[project].railway.app/health`
4. **Check database** → Railway dashboard → PostgreSQL status
5. **Restart if needed** → Railway dashboard → Restart
6. **If DB issue** → Check DATABASE_URL env var
7. **If persistent** → Rollback to previous deployment

---

### If payments failing:

1. **Check Alchemy status** → status.base.org
2. **Check API key** → `railway variables | grep ALCHEMY`
3. **Check recent logs** → `railway logs | grep "Payment verification"`
4. **Test manually** → Try small payment yourself
5. **If API issue** → Wait for Alchemy to recover
6. **If config issue** → Fix ALCHEMY_API_KEY or HUB_WALLET_ADDRESS

---

### If AI generation failing:

1. **Check Anthropic status** → status.anthropic.com
2. **Check API credits** → console.anthropic.com
3. **Check recent logs** → `railway logs | grep "AI generation"`
4. **Test manually** → Try job creation yourself
5. **If quota issue** → Add more credits
6. **If model issue** → Check Anthropic status page

---

### If high memory usage:

1. **Check Railway metrics** → Memory graph
2. **Check for memory leak** → Restart and monitor
3. **Check logs** → Look for error patterns
4. **Review recent deploys** → Did new code cause it?
5. **Scale up if needed** → Railway plan upgrade
6. **Fix leak if found** → Deploy patch

---

## Success Metrics

**Healthy system should show:**

✅ Uptime: > 99% (< 7 hours downtime/month)
✅ Payment success rate: > 95%
✅ AI generation success rate: > 90%
✅ Average response time: < 2 seconds
✅ Memory usage: < 70% average

## Lessons Learned

### Documentation Pays Off

Creating comprehensive launch materials upfront ensures:
- Nothing forgotten during launch
- Professional presentation
- Clear monitoring strategy
- Easier onboarding for future contributors

### Checklists Reduce Anxiety

Having a clear Go/No-Go checklist removes ambiguity about launch readiness.

### Demo Materials are Marketing

Good demo video and screenshots are as important as the product itself.
