## Notes

- **Planning Depth**: Comprehensive (thorough coverage, don't compress)
- **Workflow Mode**: YOLO (auto-approve, execute without confirmation)
- **Codebase State**: ~60% complete, brownfield project
- **Critical Path**: Phases 1-5 required for basic launch
- **Budget Constraint**: Minimize API costs (Anthropic, Replicate, Alchemy)
